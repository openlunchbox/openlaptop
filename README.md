Open Source Laptop

Open Lunchbox could be the first open source modular laptop. The problem is that the silicon vendors have stopped releasing open source to the firmware.

AMD made a decision back in 2014 to supply AGESA as binary-only for future AGESA releases.

We could offer all the design files, mainboards and laptop components as kits, parts or as complete assembled and tested modules.
